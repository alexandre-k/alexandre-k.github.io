# A blog about functional programming.

For now, my purpose is to use it as a way to wrap my mind around concepts or to have a kind of memo to write down how to
do things which were not obvious for me at first. Explaining things is a great way to improve our own understanding.

The purpose of this blog will probably evolve with time.

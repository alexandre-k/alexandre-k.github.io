        <h1 id="applicative-and-monatid-styles">Applicative and monatid styles</h1>
<h1 id="fmap-and-return">Fmap and Return</h1>
<p>Coming from Python, I needed some time to wrap my mind around <code>return</code>. It has nothing to do with <code>return</code> in Python.</p>
<p>Let us say we want to compute an age any given integer entered from the command line. We could use the <code>fmap</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>
displayAge :: Maybe Integer -&gt; IO ()
displayAge age =
  case age of
    Nothing -&gt; putStrLn &quot;You did not enter a valid date&quot;
    Just theYear -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;In 2020 you will be &quot; ++ show theYear


computeAge :: Integer -&gt; Integer
computeAge year = 2020 - year

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter you birth date:&quot;
  year &lt;- getLine
  let computedAge = fmap computeAge (readMay year :: Maybe Integer)
  displayAge computedAge</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we use <code>fmap</code> to compute a value wrapped up inside a <code>Maybe</code>. It won’t compute anything if it is Nothing. Then it would display “You did not enter a valid date”. <code>fmap</code> is really a powerful way in Haskell to easily get around a wrapped value and make any computation given a value.</p>
<p>The other equivalent way is the do-notation, where instead of using <code>fmap</code> we unwrap a value with the slurp operator, <code>&lt;-</code>, and then feed it to <code>return</code>, which is actually a function, not just a keyword to return a value like in Python. So the following bit is strictly equivalent to the previous one:</p>
<pre><code>displayAge :: Maybe Integer -&gt; IO ()
displayAge age =
  case age of
    Nothing -&gt; putStrLn &quot;You did not enter a valid date&quot;
    Just theYear -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;In 2020 you will be &quot; ++ show theYear

computeAge :: Integer -&gt; Integer
computeAge year = 2020 - year

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter you birth date:&quot;
  year &lt;- getLine
  let computedAge = do
        theYear &lt;- readMay year :: Maybe Integer
        return $ computeAge theYear
  displayAge computedAge</code></pre>
<p>The do-notation being used only in the case of Monads. Further explanations are in <a href="https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/advanced-haskell/functors-applicative-functors-and-monads">this wonderful post</a>.</p>
<h1 id="monadic-vs-applicative">Monadic vs applicative</h1>
<p>Now if we want to pass several arguments to our computeAge function, we would use multiple times the slurp operator in our do block. Nothing fancy here:</p>
<pre><code>displayAge :: Maybe Integer -&gt; IO ()
displayAge age =
  case age of
    Nothing -&gt; putStrLn &quot;You did not enter a valid date&quot;
    Just theYear -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;In 2020 you will be &quot; ++ show theYear

computeAge :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
computeAge futureYear year = futureYear - year

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter you birth date:&quot;
  year &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn &quot;Enter a future year&quot;
  futureYear &lt;- getLine
  let computedAge = do
        theYear &lt;- readMay year :: Maybe Integer
        theFutureYear &lt;- readMay futureYear :: Maybe Integer
        return $ computeAge theFutureYear theYear
  displayAge computedAge</code></pre>
<p>As I said, nothing fancy, quite a beginner-friendly way of using wrapped values.</p>
<p>Now let’s say we want to use <code>fmap</code>. It basically takes one function and one <code>Maybe Integer</code> to return one <code>Maybe a</code>. So to use fmap, we would need to curry the function or to use apply, the <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operator in Haskell. Why? The apply operator, <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>, apply a function inside a functor (think of <code>computeAge</code> as a curried function) to a value inside a functor (our <code>Maybe Integer</code>).</p>
<p>Then our previous code in the monadic style would become this, in an applicative style:</p>
<pre><code>displayAge :: Maybe Integer -&gt; IO ()
displayAge age =
  case age of
    Nothing -&gt; putStrLn &quot;You did not enter a valid date&quot;
    Just theYear -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;In 2020 you will be &quot; ++ show theYear

computeAge :: Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer
computeAge futureYear year = futureYear - year

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter you birth date:&quot;
  year &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn &quot;Enter a future year&quot;
  futureYear &lt;- getLine
  let theYear = readMay year :: Maybe Integer
  let theFutureYear = readMay futureYear :: Maybe Integer
  let computedAge = fmap computeAge theFutureYear
                        &lt;*&gt; theYear
  displayAge computedAge
</code></pre>
<p>Not so much beginner friendly style I would say, although it looks nice if we replace <code>fmap</code> with its infix equivalent, <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let computedAge = computeAge
                        &lt;$&gt; theFutureYear
                        &lt;*&gt; theYear</code></pre>
<h1 id="to-lift-or-not-to-lift">To lift or not to lift</h1>
<p>Altough we could stop here, let us rewrite our monadic version with <code>liftM2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter you birth date:&quot;
  year &lt;- getLine
  putStrLn &quot;Enter a future year&quot;
  futureYear &lt;- getLine
  displayAge $ liftM2 computeAge (readMay futureYear :: Maybe Integer)
                                 (readMay year :: Maybe Integer)</code></pre>
<p>This is strictly equivalent to what we did before. I just applied <code>liftM2</code> to replace the do notation. Since I have a <code>Maybe</code> type and the monadic actions depend on the previous one, I use <code>liftM2</code> instead of <code>liftM</code>. See <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Applicative_functor">the wiki</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Still, what is the purpose of lifting something in Haskell? Will see that in a next post.</p>
